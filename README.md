Performing analysis on a Kickstarter Data set 
### Challenge 
#### Insightfull Conclusion and Wrtitten Analysis 
From the Kickstarter data that was pulled and analyzed, we can draw a few conclusions. For instance, we can see there were more successful projects that were fully funded that had a goal less than $1000.00 than any other goal amount. However, there we also more total projects that were given a funding goal between $1000.00 and $4999.00. Out of the total projects, there were 16 that had a projected goal greater that $50000.00. Unfortunately, only 12.5% were successful in being funded in full. 
If we take a look at the data outcomes based on the launch date, we can conclude that the most successful period for funding were in May, September and November. In the month of December, we can see that there were nearly as many failed outcomes as successful outcomes. 
The Data set that we were provided did prove to have some complications while analyzing. One being the limitation on a more detailed overview of the breakdown of funding required. As well as some of the determining factors as to why certain projects were not successful in generating the funds at specific times of the year where others were. I believe if could gather more detailed data on the points mentioned about, we could then draw a more insightful conclusion that would have a more visual representation of how the underfunded and canceled projects could have succeeded.
